# Source Data for the project:

-x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, subject_train and subject_test contain the data from the downloaded files.
-x_data, y_data and subject_data merge the previous datasets to further analysis.
-features contains the correct names for the x_data dataset, which are applied to the column names stored in mean_and_std_features, a numeric vector used to extract the desired data.


to dowloand the datasets use the following link:

the run_analysis.R script does the following.

1-Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2-Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3-Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4-Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5-From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Descriptive activity names including:
WALKING
WALKING_UPSTAIRS
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
SITTING
STANDING
 LAYING

Variable:
